    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This project aims to visualize the advancement of women globally in areas
      such as health, education, marriage, and labor &amp; finance. The data
      used comes from The World Bank Gender Data Portal and U.S. Maternal
      Education datasets. The primary users of this information are public
      health leaders, policymakers, business investors, and the general public.</p>
    <h2 id="objectives">Objectives and Challenges</h2>
    <p>The goal is to gain insights on gender differences in health, education,
      marriage, and financial topics, globally and in the United States. We
      acknowledge the potential issues of data inequity, with missing data for
      lower-income countries and those with economic instability due to war,
      famine, and lasting impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
